    <h1><center>Khunjrab Pass</center></h1>
    <p>Khunjerab Pass, located at an elevation of approximately 4,693 meters (15,397 feet), is a high mountain pass in the Karakoram Mountains, situated on the border between Pakistan's Gilgit-Baltistan region and China's Xinjiang province. The name "Khunjerab" originates from the Wakhi language, where "Khun" means blood and "Jerab" means a creek. Historically, the pass has been a significant gateway for trade and travel.</p>

    <p>Khunjerab Pass has historically served as a vital link in the Silk Road, connecting South Asia to Central Asia and beyond. Traders, pilgrims, and invaders have used this route for centuries to transport goods, spread cultures, and establish connections between civilizations.</p>
    <p>The pass gained prominence in modern times with the construction of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), which was completed in 1978. This highway, often referred to as the "Eighth Wonder of the World," connects Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass, making it the highest paved international border crossing in the world.</p>
    <p>In the 1960s, the pass became an essential point of focus for demarcating the border between Pakistan and China. The Sino-Pakistan Agreement of 1963 officially established the Khunjerab Pass as the boundary between the two countries.</p>
